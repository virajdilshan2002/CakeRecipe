          <p>
            This <strong>Pineapple Coconut Cake</strong> includes pineapple
            chunks, coconut, coconut milk, plus homemade pineapple curd and
            cream cheese frosting. Each bite is packed with moist texture and
            irresistible flavor. Review the recipe notes before beginning. To
            save time, feel free to make the pineapple curd first. It must cool
            completely before you use it in the cake's assembly.

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease three 8-inch cake pans,
                line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment
                paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from
                the pans.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the cake:</strong> Whisk the cake flour, baking
                powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside. (Note that
                the video shows sifting the flour, but you do not have to.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk
                attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high
                speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the
                sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as
                needed. Beat in the egg whites until combined, then add the sour
                cream, vanilla extract, and coconut extract. Beat until
                combined. Mixture will look curdled as a result of the varying
                textures and solid butter combining. Scrape down the sides and
                up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low
                speed, slowly add the dry ingredients, coconut milk, and
                pineapple juice. Beat on low speed until combined, then beat in
                the shredded coconut and pineapple chunks just until combined.
                Whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no butter lumps at
                the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 22-24 minutes
                or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness,
                insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out
                clean, it's done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set
                on a wire rack. (Make the curd as the cakes cool.) The cakes
                must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the pineapple curd:</strong> Fill the bottom pot of
                a double boiler with 1-2 inches of water. (Or use the DIY double
                boiler method listed in the notes.) Place on high heat. Once the
                water begins to boil, reduce to low heat to keep the water at a
                simmer. Whisk the egg, egg yolks, granulated sugar, cornstarch,
                pineapple juice, and salt together the top pot of your double
                boiler. Continue to whisk as the curd cooks because constant
                whisking prevents the egg yolks from curdling. Whisk and cook
                until the mixture becomes slightly thick, resembling the texture
                of hollandaise sauce, about 10 minutes. If curd isn't
                thickening, turn up the heat and keep whisking. Remove pan from
                heat. Whisk in the butter. The butter will melt from the heat of
                the curd. Pour curd into a jar or bowl and place a piece of
                plastic wrap directly on top so it is touching the top of the
                curd. (This prevents a skin from forming on top.) Cool
                completely. The curd will continue to thicken as it cools. Once
                cool, the plastic wrap can be removed. Makes 1 cup. You will
                have leftover curd after using in the cake. Cover and
                refrigerate leftovers for up to 1 week.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the frosting:</strong> In a large bowl using a
                hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle
                attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium
                speed until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add
                confectioners sugar, coconut milk or pineapple juice, vanilla
                extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Beat on low
                speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2
                minutes. If you want the frosting a little thicker, add the
                extra 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar (I usually add it).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Assemble and decorate:</strong> If your cakes are domed
                on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the
                tops to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice
                cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable,
                or serving plate. I use and recommend an icing spatula to apply
                the frosting & curd. Evenly spread a scant 1/2 cup of frosting
                on top. Spread 1/4 cup of pineapple curd on top of the frosting.
                Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with 1/2 cup of
                frosting, then 1/4 cup of curd. Carefully place the third cake
                layer on top. The cake is very slippery due to the frosting and
                curd, so be careful with it. I highly recommend a crumb coat for
                this cake, so spread a very very thin layer of frosting on top
                and all around the exterior of the cake. A bench scraper is
                helpful to smooth the sides. Refrigerate crumb-coated cake for
                30-60 minutes—again, this is a slippery cake so refrigeration is
                very helpful. Remove cake from the refrigerator and spread the
                remaining frosting all over the cake. (Which should only be a
                small amount at this point.) Decorate with pineapple chunks on
                top of the cake and/or press coconut gently into the sides of
                the cake.
              </li>
              <li>
                Refrigerate cake for at least 20 minutes before slicing. This
                helps the cake hold its shape when cutting, though it's still a
                pretty fluffy cake.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up
                to 5 days
