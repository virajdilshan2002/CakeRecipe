            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line
                with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper.
                Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the
                pans.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the cake:</strong> Whisk the flour, cocoa powder,
                sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if
                using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or
                stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a
                whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high
                speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined.
                Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot
                water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is
                completely combined. Batter is thin.
              </li>
              <li>
                Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or
                until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking
                times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a
                toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (Note: Even if
                they're completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in
                the center. Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as
                all-purpose flour and can't hold up to all the moisture
                necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It's normal!)
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to
                cool completely in the pan.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the buttercream:</strong> With a handheld or stand
                mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium
                speed until creamy—about 2 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar,
                cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla
                extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high
                speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup
                more confectioners' sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too
                thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick.
                (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if
                desired.
              </li>
              <li>
                Assemble and frost: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a
                large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to
                create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes.
                Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on
                your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with
                frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all
                over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench
                scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if
                desired.
              </li>
              <li>
                Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before
                slicing to help set the shape. After that, you can serve the
                cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4-6 hours before
                serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5
                days.
              </li>
