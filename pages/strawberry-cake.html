          <p>
            This <strong>Strawberry Cake</strong> icompletely blew me away.
            After years of mediocre from-scratch strawberry cakes, my
            expectations were pretty low. It was time to taste test my efforts.
            Biting into the first pastel-pink forkful was the moment of truth…

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Make the reduced strawberry puree first, and let
                  cool:</strong
                >
                Puree 1 pound of rinsed and hulled strawberries. You should have
                a little over 1 cup. Stirring occasionally, simmer the puree
                over medium-low heat until you're left with 1/2 cup or slightly
                more (you need 1/2 cup for the cake). This takes at least 25-35
                minutes, but could take longer depending on your pan or how
                juicy your strawberries were. Allow to cool completely before
                using in cake batter. I always make the reduced puree the day
                before so it has plenty of time to cool down. I cover and place
                in the refrigerator overnight. Allow it to come back to room
                temperature before adding to the cake batter.
              </li>
              <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake
                pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the
                parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly
                release from the pans.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the cake:</strong> Whisk the cake flour, baking
                powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment,
                beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth
                and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the
                bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. Beat in
                the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes.
                Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the
                sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on
                low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With
                the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk *just*
                until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk in 1/2 cup of
                room-temperature reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are
                no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly
                thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired. (I use 1 small drop of
                pink gel food coloring.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24-25 minutes
                or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness,
                insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out
                clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans
                set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before
                frosting and assembling
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the frosting:</strong> Using a blender or food
                processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery
                crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup crumbs. Set aside. In a
                large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle
                or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese for 1 minute on high
                speed until completely smooth and creamy. Beat in the butter
                until combined. Add the confectioners' sugar, strawberry powder,
                1 Tablespoon milk, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed
                until combined and creamy. Add 1 more Tablespoon of milk to
                slightly thin out, if desired. Taste, then add a pinch of salt
                if needed. Yields about 3 cups of frosting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Assemble and frost:</strong> First, using a large
                serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to
                create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!).
                Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or
                serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd
                layer and spread the remaining frosting all over the top and
                sides. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes before slicing. This
                helps the cake keep its shape when cutting—it could slightly
                fall apart without time in the fridge.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for
                <strong>5 days.</strong>
