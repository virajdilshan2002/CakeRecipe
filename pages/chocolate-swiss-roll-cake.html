            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease a 12*17-inch baking pan
                with nonstick spray or butter, then line it with parchment paper
                so the cake seamlessly releases in step 7. Spray or grease the
                parchment paper, too. We want an extremely nonstick surface for
                this cake roll.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the cake:</strong> Using a fine mesh sieve, sift
                the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together.
                Set aside.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with whisk
                attachment, beat the egg whites and 1/4 cup (50g) granulated
                sugar together on high speed for 4-5 minutes or until
                foamy-looking medium peaks form. (Medium peaks have a slight
                droop, and aren't quite stiff.) Transfer to another bowl.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using the same mixing bowl you just had the egg whites in (no
                need to clean it), add the egg yolks and remaining sugar. Mix on
                high speed for 1 minute, and then add the oil, milk, vanilla,
                and espresso powder. Beat together on high speed for 2 minutes.
                Mixture will be thin and a little bubbly on top. Add half of the
                whipped egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Mix on low speed
                for 10 seconds. Repeat with remaining egg whites and mix on low
                for 10 seconds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sift in the flour mixture, and then fold the batter together
                with a silicone spatula until combined. Do not over-mix. Batter
                is light and fluffy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. It will be a very thin
                layer. Shimmy the pan on the counter to smooth out the top. Bake
                for 12-14 minutes or until the top of the cake lightly springs
                back when touched with your finger. Do NOT over-bake.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prepare to roll/roll the cake:</strong> As the cake
                bakes, place a piece of parchment paper (larger than the cake)
                or a thin kitchen/tea towel flat on the counter. (Note: I find a
                kitchen/tea towel is better to help prevent cracking.) Using a
                fine mesh sieve, dust parchment/towel with about 2 Tablespoons
                of cocoa powder. Once the cake comes out of the oven, quickly
                run a knife around the edges to loosen it from the pan.
                <strong>Immediately</strong> invert it onto the parchment/towel.
                Peel off the parchment paper that was on the bottom of the cake
                as it baked. Starting with the narrow end, begin tightly rolling
                the hot cake up with the parchment/towel. Do this slowly and
                gently. The cake will be warm. Allow the cake to cool completely
                at room temperature rolled up in the parchment/towel, about 3
                hours. Feel free to set it aside for up to 1 day.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the whipped cream:</strong> Using a hand mixer or a
                stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy
                cream, sugar, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until
                medium to stiff peaks form, about 2-3 minutes. Then beat in the
                marshmallow creme, if using.
              </li>
              <li>
                Slowly and gently unroll the cake. Spread whipped cream evenly
                on top, leaving about a 1/2-inch border around the cake. Gently
                roll the cake back up, without the parchment/towel this time.
                Place on a wire rack set on a baking sheet (to catch any drips
                of ganache). Set aside on the counter or in the refrigerator as
                you prepare the ganache.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make the ganache topping:</strong> Place chopped
                chocolate and corn syrup, if using, in a medium bowl. Heat the
                cream in a small saucepan until it begins to gently simmer. (Do
                not let it come to a rapid boil—that's too hot.) Pour over
                chocolate, then let sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the
                chocolate. Slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate
                is completely melted. Ganache is smooth and glossy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pour ganache all over cake roll. Feel free to spoon up any
                dripped ganache and spoon over the cake again. Refrigerate for
                at least 30-60 minutes before slicing and serving.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cover leftover cake and store in the refrigerator for up to 3
                days.
